# emotional_arcs

This repo belongs to the CLARIAH / SURF pilot 'Tools to data'. 
In this project, we test an infrastructure for running code on copyrighted materials, in this case novels.

This project will replicate and expand on existing studies on extracting and studying emotional arcs in novels. 
More details will be added shortly.
